    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design and structure software in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions. OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes.\n",
    "It follows various principles like:\n",
    "    - Encapsulation.\n",
    "    - Abstraction.\n",
    "    - Inheritance.\n",
    "    - Polymorphism.\n",
    "By adhering to these principles, OOP aims to improve the modularity, maintainability, and reusability of software, making it easier to design and manage complex systems. OOP is widely used in software development to model and solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "An object is an instance of a particular class, and it can be thought of as a self-contained unit that combines data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that objects of that class will have. A class is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) and is used to encapsulate data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are attributes and methods in a class?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "* Attributes:\n",
    "    - Attributes are variables that store data associated with a class. They define the characteristics or properties of objects created from that class. example, in a Person class, attributes might include name, age, and gender.\n",
    "    - We can access and modify attributes using dot notation, like object_name.attribute_name.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Methods:\n",
    "    - Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on the attributes of the class. They define the behavior or actions that objects of the class can perform.  example, in a Person class, you might have a method like introduce() to introduce the person.\n",
    "    - We can call methods using dot notation, like object_name.method_name().\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "class variables and instance variables are two types of variables that are used within a class to store data. \n",
    "The Difference between class variables and instance varibles are:\n",
    "    - Class variables are shared among all instances (objects) of a class and Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class.\n",
    "    - class variables are defined within the class but outside of any methods and instance variables are defined within the methods of the class and are prefixed with self to associate them with a specific instance.\n",
    "    - Class variables are associated with the class itself, not with specific instances and Instance variables are specific to the object they belong to.\n",
    "    - Class variables are often used to store data that is common to all instances of the class and Instance variables are used to store data that is unique to each instance of the class.\n",
    "    - Class variables can be accessed using the class name or an instance of the class and Instance variables are accessed and modified using the self keyword within methods of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "The self parameter in class methods is a convention and a reference to the instance of the class itself. It is used to access and manipulate instance-specific attributes and methods within the class. The self parameter serves several essential purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Accessing Instance Attributes:\n",
    "    self allows you to access and work with instance-specific attributes and data. When a method is called on an instance of a class, self gives you access to that specific instance's attributes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Modifying Instance Attributes:\n",
    "    You can use self to modify or update the values of instance variables. This ensures that changes are made to the attributes of the specific instance and not to those of other instances of the same class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Calling Other Instance Methods:\n",
    "    You can use self to call other instance methods within the same class. This allows you to chain method calls and perform a series of operations within the context of the instance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Accessing Class Variables:\n",
    "    While self is primarily used for instance-specific data, it can also be used to access class variables if needed. However, it's not required to use self for class variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "7. For a library management system, you have to design the \"Book\" class with OOP\n",
    "principles in mind. The “Book” class will have following attributes:\n",
    " - a. title: Represents the title of the book.\n",
    " - b. author: Represents the author(s) of the book.\n",
    " - c. isbn: Represents the ISBN (International Standard Book Number) of the book.\n",
    " - d. publication_year: Represents the year of publication of the book.\n",
    " - e. available_copies: Represents the number of copies available for checkout.\n",
    "- The class will also include the following methods:\n",
    " - a. check_out(self): Decrements the available copies by one if there are copies\n",
    "available for checkout.\n",
    " - b. return_book(self): Increments the available copies by one when a book is\n",
    "returned.\n",
    " - c. display_book_info(self): Displays the information about the book, including its\n",
    "attributes and the number of available copies."
