    "##### solution: \n",
    "- The main difference between string and a variable is straing is the collection of characters whereas variables stores a value or a data.\n",
    "- String is written in single or double quotes (eg: 'abc',\"abc\") whereas the variables doesnot require quotes however a variable can start with upper or lowercase alphabet or underscore.\n",

    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "##### Solution:\n",
    "##### There are different data types like numeric types, boolean types, text types, sequence type, Nonetype, set type, mapping type.\n",
    "- Numeric type consists of int and float. int numbers like 2,5,65,4 are examples of int an floating numbers like 35.5, 4.2, 3.25,2.0 are examples of float\n",
    "- Boolean types consists of values like True or False.\n",
    "- Text type consists of string which is the combination of characters. eg: \"abc\", \"123\", \"True\".\n",
    "- Sequence Type consists of lists and tuples these lists are ordered and mutable while tuples are ordered but are immutable.\n",
    "- Nonetype in this datatype the is absence of a value.\n",
    "- set type this is a type of data which is oredered and mutable of unique elements as the set does not provide duplicates in the data as output.\n",
    "- Mapping type is the type of data which contains in the form of key-value pair. in these the can be only unique keys but it is not necessary for values to be unique.\n",

    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "##### Solution:\n",
    "- The expressions are made up of operators and operands.\n",
    "- operators are basically of 3 types arithmatic (+,-,*,/), boolean/logical (True, False), comaprison(==,!=,<,>,>=,<=).\n",
    "- operands are the values in the expressions.\n",
    "- Expressions perform calculations and gets us the value or an output.\n",

    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "##### Solution:\n",
    "##### The expression basically it is the combitation of operators and operands to provide a particular output or a value while statement is kind of providing a command to a computer to do something.\n",

    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "##### 'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "##### 'spam' * 3\n",
    "##### Solution:\n",
    "##### The value of the the two expressions will be the same i.e., 'spamspamspam'\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "##### Solution:\n",
    "##### As per the rules of declaring a variable its says that the variable cannot start with special characters, integer values, keywords but the variable can be started with upper or lower case alphabets or with underscore hence eggs is a valid variable name but 100 is not.\n",

    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "##### Solution:\n",
    "- To get an integer value we can use the function int().\n",
    "- To get a floating value we can use the function float().\n",
    "- To get the string value we can use the function str().\n",

    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "##### 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "##### Solution:\n",
    "##### The following expression is trying to add a string value to the integer value which is not possible.\n",
    "##### so we need to convert the integer value i.e., 99 to a string value by using str(99) or by using quotes \"99\"."
