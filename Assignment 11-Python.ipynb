    "\n",
    "- TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.\n",

    "5. What is logging in Python, and why is it important in software development?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "Logging in Python refers to the practice of recording messages, warnings, errors, and other information generated by a software program during its execution. The Python standard library includes a built-in logging module that makes it easy to incorporate logging into your code. Logging is crucial in software development for several reasons:\n",
    "- Debugging: Logging is a valuable tool for debugging and diagnosing issues in your code. When an error occurs, you can look at the log to see what happened leading up to the error, helping you pinpoint the cause more efficiently than relying solely on print statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monitoring: In production environments, applications may run for extended periods, and you may not have access to the console. Logging allows you to monitor the behavior of your application remotely. You can collect and analyze log data to identify performance bottlenecks, security breaches, or other issues.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the logging module provides various logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and configurable handlers (e.g., writing to a file, sending to a network server, printing to the console) to control where log messages are recorded and their severity. By incorporating logging into your code, you can improve its maintainability, reliability, and overall quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the purpose of log levels in Python logging and provide examples of when\n",
    "each log level would be appropriate.\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "Log levels in Python logging are used to categorize and prioritize log messages based on their severity and importance. The purpose of log levels is to allow developers to control which messages get recorded and to what extent they affect the application's behavior. Python's logging module provides five standard log levels, in increasing order of severity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DEBUG: The lowest log level, used for detailed debugging information. These messages are typically only of interest to developers and are used during the development and testing phases to diagnose issues and inspect the internal state of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- INFO: Used to provide informational messages about the normal operation of the application. These messages can be helpful for tracking the flow of the program and providing context about what's happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "- WARNING: Indicates potential issues that are not necessarily errors but may warrant attention. For example, a warning could be used to alert about deprecated features or suboptimal configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ERROR: Indicates errors or exceptional conditions that might lead to a failure in the application. When an error is logged, it typically means that something has gone wrong and needs to be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CRITICAL: The highest log level, used for severe errors that may cause the application to crash or become unstable. Critical messages are reserved for the most severe issues that require immediate attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are log formatters in Python logging, and how can you customise the log message format using formatters?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "In Python logging, log formatters are used to define the structure and content of log messages. They allow you to customize the way log messages are formatted before they are written to the log output, such as a file, console, or a remote server. Log formatters are particularly useful for creating human-readable and machine-parseable log entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logging module provides a built-in Formatter class that you can use to define the format of log messages. You can customize log message format by creating an instance of the Formatter class and attaching it to a logging handler.\n",

    "9. What is the difference between the logging and print statements in Python? When should you use logging over print statements in a real-world application?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "Both logging and print statements in Python are used for generating output, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: Logging is primarily used for capturing and recording information about the behavior and state of an application during its runtime. It's used for debugging, monitoring, error tracking, and auditing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configurability: Logging provides a high degree of configurability. You can specify different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), format log messages, and direct log output to various destinations (e.g., files, console, network, email).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Granularity: Logging allows you to log messages at various levels of severity. This fine-grained control allows you to filter and analyze log data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Persistence: Log messages are typically written to a log file or another persistent medium, allowing you to review them even after the program has finished running.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concurrency: Logging is thread-safe and can be used in multi-threaded or multi-process applications without issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Print Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: Print statements are used for immediate, ad-hoc output to the console. They are typically used for debugging and quick inspection of variables or program flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configurability: Print statements are not highly configurable. You can print values to the console, but there are limited formatting options.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Granularity: Print statements don't provide different log levels like logging. Everything you print will be displayed, regardless of its importance or severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Persistence: Print statements send output to the console, and this output is not easily persisted for future analysis, especially if the program is long-running or running in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concurrency: Print statements are generally not thread-safe, and printing from multiple threads or processes concurrently can lead to jumbled or interleaved output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "10. Write a Python program that logs a message to a file named \"app.log\" with the following requirements:\n",
