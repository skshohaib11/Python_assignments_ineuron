    "* 1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "* It represents an empty list\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "#### Solution: \n",
    "* 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "#### Solution: \n",
    "* [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True,99]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "* List concatenation operators are the operators will adds the two or more sets of list which creates a newly formed list containing the elements of all the added lists. list concatenation operator is '+'\n",
    "* List replication operator are the operators that multiplies the list the number of times we want to which gives the newly formed list the times we want to replicate. list replication operator is '*'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "* The list method append add the element at the last postion of the existing list, it takes the single argument which is the element you want to add. while insert is used to add the element in the list at the desired place we want to add, insert takes two arguments the index number where you want to add element and value of element which you want to add.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "####Solution:\n",
    "* The two methods of removing an item from the list are pop() and remove(). pop() removes the last element in the list and remove() removes the element from a list which you want to remove.it takes one argument which i.e., the element which you want to remove.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "* both lists and strings are in sequence or in a particular order\n",
    "* We can iterate from both lists and strings.\n",
    "* We can use indexing and slicing in both strings and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "* The major difference between tuples and lists are lists are mutable and tuples are immutable.\n",
    "* lists elements are enclosed in the square brackets [] while tuple elements are stored in round brackets () hence lists contains all the elements which might need any mutation in future while tuples is used when we dont want any alteration in elements in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "tuple = (42,)   \n",
    "* The comma after the value 42 is essential, even though the tuple contains only one element. This comma distinguishes the tuple from just using parentheses for grouping and makes it clear that you're creating a tuple with a single item.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "#### Solution: \n",
    "* We can get a list values in tuple form and visa versa by using type casting methods.\n",
    "* suppose we have variable a =[1,2,3] we can convert this to tuple by using tuple(a)\n",
    "* suppose we have variable a =(1,2,3) we can convert this to tuple by using list(a)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "* Variables in Python that \"contain\" list values actually contain references to the memory locations where the list data is stored. It does not store every elements in the memory but it in the form of data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "* copy and deep copy is used to create a copy of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shallow copy:\n",
    "* The copy() function creates a shallow copy of an object.\n",
    "* shallow copy of an object is a new object that is a copy of the original object's content, but it doesn't recursively copy nested objects. Instead, it creates references to the same nested objects as the original. \n",
    "* Shallow copying is useful when you want to duplicate the top-level structure of a complex object, but you're okay with shared references to nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep copy:\n",
    "* Thedeepcopy() function creates a deep copy of an object.\n",
    "* A deep copy creates an entirely new object hierarchy, recursively copying all nested objects as well.\n",
    "* Deep copying is useful when you want to completely isolate the copied object from the original, including all nested objects."
